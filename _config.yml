# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: I am currently a postdoc in the Baumann Lab research group at the Johanes Gutenberg University, Mainz, where I completed my PhD. My doctoral research centered on unraveling the genetic and epigenetic diversity within clonal whiptail lizards, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms driving evolutionary adaptation in clonal reptilian populations. I am deeply interested in using molecular and bioinformatic tools to unravel the phenotypic responses of organisms to environmental changes. Through my interdisciplinary approach, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology, with a focus on enhancing conservation efforts and fostering resilience in natural ecosystems. This interest in leveraging genomics to understand ecosystem dynamics began in my Zoology degree from Cardiff University. This interest was further developed at Queen Mary University of London, where I pursued a Master's in Ecology and Evolutionary Genomics. During this time, I focused on molecular diagnostics, focusing particularly on assessing pollinator healthâ€”a critical aspect of ecosystem dynamics.
